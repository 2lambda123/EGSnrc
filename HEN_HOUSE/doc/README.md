## EGSnrc documentation

The EGSnrc user manuals in PDF format can be downloaded from the
[releases](https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc/releases) page. Download
the `EGSnrc-manuals.zip` archive, unzip it and copy the extracted PDF files
to your `$HEN_HOUSE/doc` directory if you want.

The `src` folder contains the LaTeX source code for all the manuals, but you
might not be able to compile them on your computer if you don't have LaTeX or
all the required LaTeX packages.
